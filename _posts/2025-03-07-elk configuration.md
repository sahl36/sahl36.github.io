# 🚀 ELK Stack Installation & Configuration Guide  

Are you ready to dive into **log management, security monitoring, and threat detection** using the powerful **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**? This comprehensive guide walks you through the entire **installation and configuration process** along with **Filebeat**, helping you streamline log collection and analysis efficiently.  

## 🔍 What is the ELK Stack?  
The **ELK Stack** is a powerful open-source solution used for **log management, security analytics, and real-time monitoring**. It consists of:  
- **Elasticsearch** – A search and analytics engine to store and query log data.  
- **Logstash** – A data processing pipeline that collects, filters, and sends logs to Elasticsearch.  
- **Kibana** – A visualization tool that allows you to analyze and create dashboards for log data.  
- **Filebeat** – A lightweight log shipper that collects logs from different sources and forwards them to Logstash or Elasticsearch.  

## 📌 What You'll Learn in This Guide:  
✅ **Step-by-step installation & setup** of Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and Filebeat.  
✅ How to **configure Elasticsearch** with essential security settings.  
✅ Setting up **Kibana dashboards and detection rules** for real-time security monitoring.  
✅ **Logstash pipeline configuration** for efficient log processing.  
✅ Troubleshooting **common errors and issues** to ensure a smooth setup.  
✅ How to **automate security alerts** in Kibana for **threat detection** and **incident response**.
